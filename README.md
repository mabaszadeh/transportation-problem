# Transportation-Problem

Solving **Transportation Problem** (TP) and Optimizing by Implementing **Genetic Algorithm**.

## How to use it?

Create an input file like ones in `inputs` directory and change **`in1`** of `from inputs.in1 import *`, the first cell of `transportation-problem.ipynb`, to your file name you 've created.

## Examples

| Inputs | Outputs |
| - | - |
| [in1.py](inputs/in1.py) | [out1.txt](outputs/out1.txt) |
| [in2.py](inputs/in2.py) | [out2.txt](outputs/out2.txt) |
| [in3.py](inputs/in3.py) | [out3.txt](outputs/out3.txt) |
| [in4.py](inputs/in4.py) | [out4.txt](outputs/out4.txt) |
